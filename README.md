# Language Detection Model

## Overview

**Language Detection Model** is a machine learning project designed to identify the language of a given text using deep learning techniques. This model can detect and classify texts into multiple languages with high accuracy. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks to create an efficient and scalable solution for language detection.

The notebook covers the following stages:
- **Data preprocessing**: Text tokenization, language label encoding, and dataset cleaning.
- **Model architecture**: A deep neural network designed to recognize patterns in language structure.
- **Training**: Model training with relevant multilingual datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Detects a wide range of languages.
- **Scalable Model**: Can be trained on larger datasets and adapted for more languages.
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed evaluation through accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss tracking.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a robust deep learning model that can accurately identify the language of input text, enhancing the efficiency of text classification systems for multilingual content.

## Dependencies

The project relies on various Python libraries, including:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on your model framework)
- `nltk` or `spaCy` for text preprocessing

## Usage

- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DrInsane10/Language-Detection-Model.git
   cd language-detection-model
   ```


## Results

The model achieves [0.98] on the test dataset. Below is a sample confusion matrix showing the performance across different languages.
